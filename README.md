# cse5525_final_project

## Description

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.12+
```bash
python --version  # Windows
python3 --version  # Linux
```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project root

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SBroaddus220/cse5525_final_project
cd cse5525_final_project
```

2. Create virtal environment of your choice (optional)
Example with Python's built-in `venv`
```bash
python -m venv .venv
./.venv/Scripts/activate  # Activate on Windows
source ./.venv/bin/activate  # Activate on Linux
```

3. Install project dependencies
```bash
python -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application
To run the application, run:
```bash
python ./main.py
```

### Running Scripts
There are several scripts in the `./scripts` directory. These can be run as any python script.
Please refer to the docstrings of any script for any specific instructions.
```bash
# Example format
python ./scripts/script.py
```

## Configuration File
Modifying the configuration file is unneeded, but if you want some customization (e.g. modifying logging config), then feel free to edit the config file at `./cse5525_final_project/config.py`

## Creating New Metrics
In this application, metrics for the files are systematically generated by using modular logic in an abstract class. New metrics can easily be added by providing logic for the SQLITE table and the metric calculation. 

The system's metrics can be found at `./cse5525_final_project/metrics.py` for reference.

A template for automatic generation of a Metric class through an LLM is provided at `./llm_metric_generation_template.md`.
To use this template, please replace the existing comments with specific details regarding the metric, and then insert the generated class into the metrics file.
